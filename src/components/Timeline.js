            Having <b>fast code</b> can mean the{" "}
            <b>difference between taking several years and a few seconds</b> to
            find the fastest route to your house on Google Maps. Algorithms such
            as Djikstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm and quicksort are responsible
            for speeding up code by finding clever ways to reduce computations.
